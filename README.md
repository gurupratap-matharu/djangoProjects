Hi Veer. 

If you can read this then we have successfully installed git on the windows machine.
Now we can upload our projects on git and can access them form anywhere.

Hey Veer,

	Now if you can read this then we have installed and configure git on the portable Lubuntu 
installation. How cool is that. 

									Happy coding.
